# didactic

This package provides macros and environments useful for writing teaching 
material. It provides more semantic environments on top of the standard 
`definition`, `theorem`, and friends: for instance, `exercise`, `activity` and 
`question`. These are suitably colour coded when used with Beamer. They occur 
as "normal" text in handouts produced by `beamerarticle` (same style as 
`definition` usually has).

It also provides macros for typesetting code listings and output side by side.

Finally, it modifies the appearance of `beamer` (Berlin based theme) and 
`memoir` (Tufte style layout), if loaded. It's designed to be used with 
`beamer` to produce slides and `beamerarticle` with `memoir` to produce notes, 
and handouts from the same source.
